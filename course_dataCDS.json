Through data modeling and visualization, students will construct and communicate arguments that are rooted in data. The course expects only basic computer knowledge and teaches concepts and skills in computer programming (Python), linear regression, and statistical inference. The course delves into dilemmas surrounding data analysis, such as balancing individual privacy and social utility, and prepares students for the data driven world all around us. Students with interests from politics to sports, finance to journalism, entrepreneurship to smart cities, etc., can use the knowledge of data science they gain in this class to enhance those interests. Not to mention a grounding for students who want to pursue the field of data science itself.

Biological research is rarely unequivocal in its findings; students will learn to systematically identify the claims advanced in research papers and evaluate whether each claim is established beyond a reasonable doubt by supporting evidence. We will examine papers that both meet and fail this test. In today's biology, to properly examine a paper in this way it is increasingly important to engage with the data provided as supporting evidence, and to critically examine the computational approach. Students will work with published data and computational tools. Further, students will learn to identify the ideology implicit in each paper, to understand how ideology shapes both the research questions and approach, and to imagine the same research under an alternative mindset. Classes will be split into lectures on background material for each paper and group discussions. Students will work in small groups to write a report on each paper. Each student will work on a final project to produce a critical review of a broader topic in the field.

In particular we will look into the different flavors of compute, storage and networking available, how best to use them to solve interesting problems, and how to do everything on a constrained budget. Students will get accounts and deliver project work on the public cloud while also learning some of the fundamental principles on how those different cloud systems work under the covers.

Before beginning an external lab rotation, students are expected to develop a plan for the scope and expected outcomes of the work to be pursued under the supervision of a named lab rotation advisor. This plan must be pre-approved by the student's academic, research, or thesis advisor in CDS. While desirable, it is neither required nor expected that the rotation will result in completion of a substantial body of work. Lab rotation credits will be noted on the student transcript as a 4-credit pass/fail independent study course numbered as DS-990.",

        "description": "Experience with diverse research group projects and styles are an essential part of graduate training. To provide this training, graduate students are expected to complete a series of research rotations that provide them with the opportunity to (1) explore research groups where they may pursue future thesis work; (2) experience the diversity of sub-disciplines and research styles in computing and data sciences; and (3) expand their network of potential research collaborators. Before beginning a rotation, students are expected to discuss their plans with the faculty leadership of the BU research group they would like to join, leading to a clear definition of the scope and expected outcomes of the work pursued under the supervision of a named rotation advisor. While desirable, it is neither required nor expected that the rotation will result in completion of a substantial body of work. Research rotation credits will be noted on the student transcript as a 4-credit independent study course numbered as DS-991 (for Fall semester rotations) or DS-992 (for Spring semester rotations).",
