Hello! Welcome to our submission for the 2024 BUILDS x KTP x HackHardware HackInnovat3 Hackathon!

This project is an AI schedule optimizing bot that provides a service for Boston University students.
It aims to tackle the long and tedious process of research needed to plan a course schedule by searching for classes and their hub units, all based on your major!

How? First, navigate through the welcome page to get to our input and fill out your information (first name, major, minor, college, and possible course interests).
Already a Boston University student and need help moving on from where you are now? No problem! Input your transcript and we'll do the work for you.
Finally, the magic happens when our AI helper bot communicates with you and lets you know what courses you should take. If you have any inquiries, simply let them know!

The tools to make this happen were React, JavaScript, SCSS, HTML, Python, Flask, and JSON APIs.
