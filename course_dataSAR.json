The course is designed with an intent of putting oneself in the shoes of a clinician as well as a manager, with acknowledgement that leaders in the health care environment are rarely able to ignore sound management principles and understanding of healthcare systems for long. Whether knowing what is being asked of you as a clinician, or being placed in a leadership position, many health and rehabilitation professionals will assume the role of a manager or have leadership responsibilities during the course of their career, often sooner than expected. The increasing rate of change in the healthcare environment is a major factor in this emphasis on leadership. This can take many forms, and an emphasis will be placed on how one can assume a position of leading in different avenues. This course will help foster the growth of an individual's knowledge and capacity to lead, in whatever form it takes. This course also develops and enhances the students' understanding of the health care system, the social and economic forces affecting the health care system, and its ability to function effectively. Additionally, the course will prepare students to enter the workforce by introducing them to a variety of tools and experiences that will enable them to manage organizations, programs, resources, and people more effectively. Emphasis in this course is on US and Massachusetts's policies and legislation, managing human resources, marketing, technology and information, accounting and finance, quality improvement, and measuring performance.
