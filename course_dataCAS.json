Pre-reqs: CAS LX 250, Introduction to Linguistics, or equivalent. Languages become \"endangered\" or \"dormant\" for multiple reasons, and efforts to revitalize languages take many paths. We examine key cases of language revitalization, including examples from around the world, but with a primary focus on indigenous languages of North America. Topics for Spring 2024: Section A1: Truth. Approaches the notion of truth through the study of lies and other forms of deception, partial truths, imprecision, subjectivity, bullshit, hustle, and nonsense. Builds on perspectives from linguistics, philosophy, media/communication, law (perjury), and political science (fact-checking). Section B1: Metrics and Evaluation in Natural Language Processing. Pre-reqs: CAS LX 250, Introduction to Linguistics, and CAS LX 496, Computational Linguistics, or equivalents. Much recent progress has been made in Natural Language Processing, sometimes accompanied by descriptions like \"human-level performance\". This course serves as an introduction to how \"progress\" is measured and evaluated, and invites broader discussions about claims of human parity.",

Writing in mathematics is distinctive for at least two reasons: i) in addition to written language, mathematical writing involves numbers, symbols, and images; and ii) mathematicians write not only to communicate their work, but more perhaps importantly to clarify and refine their own thinking. In this class, we explore how writing is used to both communicate and facilitate mathematics by participating in the process of writing across a range of discipline-specific genres, including proof writing and expository writing, for distinct audiences such as peer mathematicians and the public. In order to receive credit for MA 301 a student must 1) have not yet received credit for any MA courses numbered 500 and above OR 2) have already received credit for MA courses numbered 500 but received no grades of A- or higher in any of them.

We cover the analysis of reasoning with truth-functions (\"and\", \"or\", \"not\", \"if ... then\") and with quantifiers (\"all\", \"some\"), attending to formal languages and axiomatic systems for logical deduction. Throughout, we aim to clearly and systematically display both the theory underlying the norms of valid reasoning and their applications to particular problems of argumentation. The course is an introduction to first-order quantificational logic, a key tool underlying work in foundations of mathematics, philosophy of language and mind, philosophy of science and parts of syntax and semantics.
