Students will learn how to identify and use common persuasive proposal structures, craft effective arguments to motivate engineering research, analyze drafts to identify common pitfalls writers fall into when crafting proposals, and solicit and give useful feedback on their writing. To develop these proposal writing skills, students will draft a proposal suitable for submission to external biomedical engineering funding agencies such as the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health.",

        "description": "Whether it be the FIOS? internet connection at our homes, or fiber lasers powerful enough to cut metals (many automobile chassis are now made using fiber lasers), or the ability to perform endoscopic surgery and imaging, or doing frequency metrology with super-continuum sources (the basis of a few recent Nobel prizes)... the optical fiber has played a central, often dominant, role in many applications that impact the way we live. The main function of an optical fiber is to carry an electromagnetic (in the optical frequency) pulse over distances ranging from meters to greater than ten thousand kilometers without distortions. Fibers can also become smart light-pipes when they are intentionally designed to alter, temporally shape or amplify light pulses. Moreover, new developments in this field such as photonic bandgap fibers, fiber nanowires and higher-order mode fibers, are opening up new directions in science and technology. This course will introduce the optical fiber waveguide and its theory of operation. Specifically, the design and impact of the two most important properties in optical fibers -- dispersion and nonlinearity -- that govern the evolution of light in optical fibers, will be covered in detail. The latter part of the course will describe new fibers and fiber-structures that are active research topics today. One lecture of the course will include a tour of an actual, industrial-scale fiber fabrication facility.",

We also discuss solution selection techniques. We then work on implementing our ideas into systems and verify that they address the product requirements and fulfill the concept we started with. During the class, we go over how to choose solutions to build our products. We also discuss real product realization, implementations and tradeoffs.

Additional design issues are also elaborated in the form of classroom lectures, which take up a fraction of the course class time. Student groups of 2-5 define their own projects, which are scrutinized by the entire class as to difficulty and possibility of success. Milestones entail both oral (presented in class times) and written components. Typically, by the time of the final presentation, the milestone documents can be simply, with test results (not necessarily simple), are combined to demonstrate the veracity of the final chip design. Pay special attention to prerequisites. Verilog is at the heart of almost everything. EC311 and EC413 or equivalent courses can provide the minimal Verilog proficiency for LEAP students.

You will become familiar with vectors and matrices, linear systems of equations, vector spaces, inner products, eigenvectors and eigenvalues and the more general singular values. You will also learn to interpret matrices as linear transformations and to understand the geometrical interpretation for operations such as solving linear systems of equations and least-squares fitting of data to models. Throughout the course, the tools will be related to specific applications to show how linear algebra is used to solve real-world problems.

The biological role of these components and their interaction with cells is also covered. Interaction of enzymes and the matrix in the presence of mechanical forces is discussed. Mathematical modeling is applied at various length scales of the extracellular matrix that provides quantitative understanding of the structure and function relationship. Special topics include how diseases affect extracellular matrix in the lung, cartilage, and vasculature. The relevance of the properties of native extracellular matrix for tissue engineering is also discussed. Same as ENG BE 549 and ENG MS 549. Students may not receive credit for both.",
