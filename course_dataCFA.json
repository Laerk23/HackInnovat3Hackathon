The thesis seminar helps prepare senior BFA students in studio degrees for writing appropriate to the field and for potential graduate study in art. Through a gradually built up process that leads to a visual and written thesis book, students will learn to write in a variety of forms. They will read and discuss related texts by artists, critics, poets and writers. The goal of the writing process is to help students recognize and clarify their artistic voice and communicate better about their own and others' work. The short and long-form writing process should help students feel more comfortable applying for residencies, grants, jobs and projects. Through this course in tandem with the senior studio course and the BFA thesis exhibition process, students will develop complexity of thinking about the intersection of professional practice, personal artistic voice, and a larger cultural context, all of which offer a culminating experience for the BFA degree.

The purpose of this course is to guide students in expressively weaving together the artistic elements of their coursework into an integrated, individual project. Capstone projects will incorporate word and image and build on arts research skills practiced in the sophomore Research Topics Seminar. Students will further develop expertise in a chosen area of studio work as well as academic, material and technological research. Focused work in the capstone will help students prepare, in a guided way, for further graduate work, academic careers and a wide range of arts-related fields that include: arts administration, cultural entrepreneurship, museum studies, arts and community development, as well as other areas outside the arts that require expertise in research, problem solving, and creative thinking. BA in Art students will present their capstone projects at the end of the semester in final critiques. The projects will include a written research paper along with a thematically/conceptually related visual project. In addition to working in the studio on individual projects, students will also regularly participate in critiques with peers and faculty, discuss readings, attend lectures and visit museums and galleries.

The course surveys the roots of contemporary art and pedagogy and the shift to postmodernism, including influential figures, theories, and trends and their impact on art education. A deep-dive investigation into masks as universal but complex, culturally-embedded phenomena provides students in the course with a unique lens. Students investigate the popularity of masks in global contemporary art and the roots of these masks that speak to culture, identity, privacy, and other issues of the moment. Responding to course content by creating art, students stretch and expand their knowledge of the mask form and use it as a tool to examine pressing issues in the contemporary art classroom. The in-depth focus enriches the background, ideas, and approaches teachers can bring to mask making, a valuable but often challenging project, but also use as a model. Through e-portfolio and online discussions, students create a community of learners. A culminating project, such as a unit plan or autoethnography, synthesizes traditional research methods with arts-research insights and tackles the complexities that arise in a multi-cultural curriculum, such as appropriation, transnationalism, and ahistoricism.",

The intrinsic nature of a print involves drawing, creating multiples, opacities and transparencies utilizing various materials as drawing tools. Color layering and sequences, building upon an image and taking it away again, all lead to the versatility of the medium. Color mixing, ink modification, registration and the printing of multiple-run lithographs will be taught, with an emphasis on experimentation in size, series, and thinking beyond the flat surface. A disciplined approach to cooperative print shop use, how a professional print atelier runs, and proper care and maintenance of equipment will be covered. Students will build confidence in printing editions, working collaboratively with invited artists, and developing work that supports and extends their overall studio practice. Critiques, both one-on-one and in groups, combined with presentations on well-known artists, visits to professional print ateliers and print collections, and guest speakers will showcase current trends in the medium and its part in the contemporary printmaking landscape.",

        "description": "The practicum II course serves to ground the theory and knowledge acquired in previous coursework to practical field applications within the art classroom in a PreK-12 school, at Elementary or Secondary level. The practicum II provides pre-service candidates with experience in planning, implementing and assessing art experiences for children and youth while developing classroom management skills and reflective practice, as they work alongside a licensed art teacher/supervising practitioner. With their mentor's guidance, students develop and teach art lessons, completing a minimum of 300 hours of internship in the art classroom of which 100 are in full responsibility of the class. The practicum is overseen by a program supervisor who observes the teaching practice of the candidate, advising and reporting on the candidate's progress. A successful practicum culminates with an endorsement for an initial license in the teaching of visual arts (PreK-8 or 5-12 depending on the practicum placement) as established by the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. This course is taken concurrently with CFA AR 564: Art Education Seminar: Curriculum and Instruction II.",

The implications of assuming leadership are vast----vision, exertion, generosity, intelligence, precision, responsibility, compassion ... Furthermore, to lead cannot mean to ignore the complex reality we live in as a society: Inequity, social disparities, structural racism and discrimination are not undesired mistakes, but structural aspects of the world we live in. In other words, the way our society defines what is \"leadership\" and \"who should lead\" has the power to perpetuate, or for the same matter, dismantle these issues. Our collective inquiry and discussion will inevitably deal with this pressing reality. A group of global art leaders, activists and entrepreneurs from across the globe will join the forum to illustrate, enrich and guide this discussion. The \"Art Leaders Forum\" is a co-creation process in need of every voice and every view that engages in it. Tourism is not an option here: taking part in the forum clearly demands something of each of us----to fully listen and to dare to be heard; to be seen and to see others and their reality. To support and enhance such demanding work the course will introduce notions of mindfulness, entrepreneurship, active listening, embodiment and non-violent communication, at the time that will study and explore different models of leadership, activism, community and social impact in the arts.",

Through these musical practices, we will investigate the ways in which many of these styles are the product of long running intra/intercultural dialogues, struggles, and negotiation processes that continue to produce new hybrid forms. Because of the vast array of people and cultures within each selected area, this course is necessarily selective and introductory. A variety of scholars and performing artists will be invited to give a workshop on music/dance and discuss their lives as musicians. Over the course of the semester, you will gain an understanding of the myriad ways people use music to construct and individual group identities, the diverse ways groups incorporate music into their lives, and how to understand music within a broader historical, political, and economic context. You will also be introduced to basic musical concepts and terminology, and acquire listening skills that will enable you to better encounter and understand music in this course and beyond. Effective Fall 2019, this course fulfills a single unit in each of the following BU Hub areas: Aesthetic Exploration, Global Citizenship and Intercultural Literacy, Research and Information Literacy.",

To the sounds of Ravel's familiar, ethereal score, the curtain lifts. But instead of a lithe ballerina in a diaphanous costume, a roller-skated dancer appears on stage. What is happening? And why? In this course, we will investigate both the whats and whys of productions like this wacky version of Daphnis: choreographers who entirely reimagine canonical ballets such as Swan Lake, Giselle, Sleeping Beauty, and The Rite of Spring among others. To that end, we work to understand the political as well as the aesthetic implications of these remade productions. Said another way, this course rethinks what ballet (with its musical as well as its danced components) can--and perhaps should--do.",

We shall not, however, exclude the possibility of bolstering our perceptions through background reading of recent and earlier literature -- analytic, historic, and hermeneutic. We shall not attempt anything like a survey. Indeed, I imagine we'll devote attention to only a handful of pieces.
